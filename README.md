React [ the way i learnt ]
--------------------------

React is javascript library not a framework like AngularJS, Angular and most of the React coding can be done by just knowing javascript and JSX. People claim react reinvented the wheel ( facebook seems to have used php with in html ) by letting javascript and html work together instead of being treated independent entity web applications. JSX is fancy way of saying html and javascript together, this requires a transpiler named 'Babel' to convert this JSX to javascript.

1. Components

Components are the way to dissect the application into smallest possible element which we can manage easily, When components are initialized react initiate the properties and we often call it `props`. Props can be used to communicate between components and meanwhile `state`'s are tied to the component and needs to be defined before using. Components let's us encapsulate, reuse and also configure them independently of each other is the main advantage.

```javascript
class ContactList extends React.Component {
  render(){

  	const people = this.props.contact
      return(
       <ol>
       	 {people.map((person,i) => (
        	<li key={i}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
       </ol>
      )
  }
}
```

2. Component ( reuse ):

ContactList component define the data rendering and presenting it to the virtual dom, we can reuse this component to output different values based on what we configure in our main app component.

```javascript
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {

		const employee = [
    	{name:'Jane'},
      {name:'Brad'}
    ]

    const reader =[
      {name:'Bob'},
      {name:'Rob'}
    ]

    return (
      <div className="App">
        <ContactList contact={employee}/>
        <ContactList contact={reader}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App/>,mountNode);
```
In App component we have reused the `ContactList` twice and configure them independently of each other to set different data values.

3. Render():

Render method in react should be kept as pure functions and responsible for handling the request to DOM and nothing else. We can always add data call such has API / Ajax request inside the render but it will hinder the performance and divert from the design pattern. So to access / fetch data from the API and then manage these data via component state ( managing component data via state is called controlled component ) can be achieved using react's lifecycle hooks.
* ComponentWillMount ( checks before component's render method mounted to the DOM )
* ComponentDidMount ( checks once the render method mounted to the DOM )

```javascript
import * as UserCall from `./UserAPI`
class App extends React.Component {

  // set to empty state
  state = {
    name:[]
  }

  // mount checks
 ComponentDidMount(){
   UserCall.getData().then((data) => this.setState({
     name: data
   }))
 }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <span> { this.state.name}</span>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App/>,mountNode);
```
* render() method will load div with empty state
* Once the DOM render is complete ComponentDidMount() is called
* setState is called and state value has been changed
* setState re-triggers the render method and render() method id called with state.name value
